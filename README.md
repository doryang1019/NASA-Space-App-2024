## 1. What does it do?
AstroMind is designed for everyone taking their first steps into the world of exoplanets. This web application caters to people curious about basic exoplanet knowledge, allowing them to dive into this fascinating field. The project utilizes a mind map concept, enabling users to learn not just through text, but also through visual memorization techniques to grasp all the key points.


## 2. How does it work?

- Space-themed navigation buttons for intuitive user interaction
- "Back" and "Main Categories" buttons for easy navigation through the mind map
- Animated hover effects on buttons to enhance user experience
- Integrated quiz module to test users' knowledge of exoplanets
- Multiple-choice questions with immediate feedback
- Score tracking and final results display



## 3. Hope to Achieve


It wasn't until I participated in a NASA hackathon that I began to learn about exoplanets. For those who have never explored this field, using AstroMind can provide a solid introduction to the concept of exoplanets. No one should be afraid to dive into new knowledge, as it can open up exciting opportunities for discovery.

by using this project, these are the potential goal we can accomplish:
- Explore different types of exoplanets visually
- Learn about the characteristics and importance of various exoplanet categories
- Test their knowledge through an interactive quiz
- Gain a deeper understanding of astronomical classifications and discoveries
